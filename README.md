# String Manipulation in Java

This project demonstrates **basic string operations** in Java, such as reversing a string, counting vowels and consonants, and checking for palindromes.  
It is a beginner-friendly program that uses core Java concepts like `String`, `StringBuilder`, loops, and conditional statements.

---

## 📌 Features
- Take a string input from the user.
- Reverse the string using **StringBuilder**.
- Count the number of **vowels** and **consonants**.
- Check if the string is a **Palindrome**.
- Print all results in a clear format.
